# SRDExtractor

A small script to copy creatures out of the [System Reference Document 5.1](https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document) I wrote since I was to lazy to copy-paste each and every creature I needed for my campaigns.  
This script has only been tested with SRD5.1 and can only extract creature entries as of now.  

**Note: this script requires pytorch as a dependency which is quite large. If you do not already have it installed on your system it might be more memory-efficient (and probably also faster) to just copy-paste directly.**

## How To Use

This script takes a list of files as a input and generates a json document as output.


## TODO
- Write **How To Use** Section
- Add support for items and spells.
